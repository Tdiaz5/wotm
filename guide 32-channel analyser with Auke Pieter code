On 14/06 Auke Pieter, AP, gave an explanation of the multi channel analyser and how it functions. 
The firmware for the analyser was made for a project for AP. What the firmware can do can be seen from the firmware gui on the pc. 
The energy values displayed are in channel counts. 
The multi channel analyser can readout 2^14 different voltages across a range of 0-2V. 
This means that each channel count is 0.1221 mV. 
The time values are in clock cycles which are 12.5 ns. 

The settings for each channel seperately are:

- (GAIN) Amplify the voltages recieved such that the detected voltages become higher or lower.

- (THRS) trigger on a threshold energy value above a baseline

- (INVERT) Invert the recieved voltages such that the signal becomes a positive peak

- (BASE) install a baseline voltage. 
  A dynamic baseline voltage is calibrated by the firmware after each trigger but BASE will be used as the starting point for the calibration.

- (TOFF) The time-offset. It is there to make sure that t=0 is the same for all channels.

-(HV) unkown

The settings for the data analysis in general are:

- (INTTIME) the timewindow used for integration. 
  The surface area under the curve and above the baseline is proportional to the total energy deposited by the muon. 
  INTTIME determines for how long the curve will be integrated

- (PREINIT) unkwown

- (BLLEN) the length of time during which the baseline is calibrated. (BASE) will be used as a starting point. 

-(BLHOLD) the time waited after which the baseline is calibrated.

- (WINDOW) The time window in which decays or double decays can occur.

- (V_offset) the voltage offset before the data enters the channel. 
  Alter if the signal goes outside the limits of the multi channel analyser.

- (NMIN) how many channels need to have hit above the threshold before the event is saved. 
  If less than NMIN channels record a peak over threshold the event will be discarded

- (EMIN) The minimum deposited energy summed across all channels required to save the event. 
  If an event occurs but the integrated energy of both channels summed together is less than EMIN the event will be discarded.
